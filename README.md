# Frontend Mentor - QR code component solution

This is a solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H). Frontend Mentor challenges help me improve my coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Overview

### Screenshot

![](./design/desktop-design.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process
- I bring the template and starter file from frontend mentor site 
- understand it and delete some unnessary files, then create a custom folder and files, and wrote own code
- then create a remote respositry on github, and push it. *i was facing some conflicts and problem with branching, merging, restor the previous solution etc. with git, then i decided to clear my basic concept first with git & github then move forward, so i learn it.* 
- the resource is mention here: [resource](#Useful-resources) 
- i lack the consitency for few day's because i was feeling am too slow and unable to reach expecation. and this simple project is taking more time from me, - as compare to watching the tutorial and building one. *but i was wrong* 
- then after a week, i forget all my mistake, inconsistency, guilt and decide to finish it. i woke up early set the deep work session. did it. _still the responsiveness is missing i will add it soon_
