- Solution URL: [GitHub Repositry](https://github.com/arunkhairwar/QR-card-layout.git)
- Live Site URL: [soon](#nothing)

## My process

- I bring the template and starter file from frontend mentor site
- understand it and delete some unnessary files, then create a custom folder and files, and wrote own code
- then create a remote respositry on github, and push it. _i was facing some conflicts and problem with branching, merging, restor the previous solution etc. with git, then i decided to clear my basic concept first with git & github then move forward, so i learn it._
- the resource is mention here: [resource](#Useful-resources)
- i lack the consitency for few day's because i was feeling am too slow and unable to reach expecation. and this simple project is taking more time from me, - as compare to watching the tutorial and building one. _but i was wrong_
- then after a week, i forget all my mistake, inconsistency, guilt and decide to finish it. i woke up early set the deep work session. did it. _still the responsiveness is missing i will be adding it soon_

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
<!--
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
  -->

### What I learned

this project helped me to learn and explore more about version contorl and common use of it. like why we need to use it, and how important it is to manage our code. apart from this i learn about

- how to achieve responsivenss using pure CSS code without any framework,
- learn flexbox and it's usage.

some code snippets, see below:

#HTML
```html
<div class="card-layout">
  <div class="QR">
    <img src="/images/image-qr-code.png" alt="qr" />
  </div>
  <div class="otherInfo">
    <h3>Visit My Portfolio by Scaning this QR</h3>
    <p>
      scan the QR to visit my portfolio and explore more about me. like past
      expreience, project etc.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
```
#CSS
```css
.card-layout {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: space-between;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  background-color: white;
  /* position: absolute; */
  margin-top: 70px;
  width: 250px;
  height: 400px;
  border: 2px solid black;
  border-radius: 20px;
}
```
#JavaScript 
```js {
alert("currently the QR will not land you on my Portfolio, so please don't mind ðŸ˜Š")
 }
```
